# blackjack-server
This server delt all of the hands of blackjack to test student's player-code in NHS Computer Science, 2014-2015. Below is a graph of an example run, displaying the student account balances as ~1400 hands of blackjack are delt.  Various algorithms were tested by the different groups.  Interestingly, the simplest algorithms tended to do better than attempts at implementing card counting.
